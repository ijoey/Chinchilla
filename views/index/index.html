	<h1>Origin of Chinchilla, the RESTful framework</h1>
	<p>The underpinnings of the Chinchilla project began around 2004 out of a desire to learn and implement software design patterns and object oriented principles. PHP is an easy development environment, so that's what I used. It has morphed into a RESTful implementation with a Front Controller that maps HTTP requests to resource object methods.</p>
	<h2>The Basic Idea</h2>
	<p>The Front Controller processes HTTP requests except for javascript, stylesheet and image resources. It instantiates an object based on the URL. For instance, an HTTP GET request to /index/ results in an instance of the index_resource class being instantiated and the method, "GET", called on it. The output of that method is the response to the HTTP GET request. An HTTP POST request results in the method, "POST", getting called on an instance of the index_resource class. As with the DELETE HTTP method, "DELETE". However, the DELETE method is not handled consistently across browsers so I added a hidden field called "_method" which contains the intended HTTP method to call on a resource. It's typically DELETE and PUT.</p>
	<h2>What Next?</h2>
	<p>I've created a public repository at <a href="http://github.com/ijoey/Chinchilla">(Chinchilla on) GitHub</a> so go get it and take a look. I'm actively developing it and would love ya'll to use it and give me your feedback, suggestions, comments, critics, complaints, etc. Please contact me via <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>
